<h3>My Goals for DxMentorship</h3> <br/>

As a participant in the DxMentorship program, I aim to enhance my skills, expand my professional network, and position myself for a successful career in Developer Relations. By the end of this mentorship, I want to: <br/><br/>

✅ Improve my technical writing skills to create high-quality blogs and documentation. <br/>

✅ Launch my YouTube channel and start sharing developer-focused content. <br/>

✅ Connect with experienced professionals and build meaningful relationships in the DevRel space. <br/>

✅ Secure a full-time role as a Developer Advocate 🥑 or DevRel Engineer 👨‍💻. <br/>

I’m excited about this journey and looking forward to learning, growing, and making an impact!
