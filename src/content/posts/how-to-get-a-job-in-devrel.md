## What is DevRel?
DevRel (Developer Relations) aims at fostering positive relationships between a company and the developers who use its products. It involves activities such as organizing events, providing support, and creating resources to help developers succeed with the company's products. 

Basically, it's about building an active community around the product and supporting developers in their journey with the company's technology.

A DevRel role can differ depending on the company's needs; some may need DevRel professionals to create clear technical documentation, curate content ideas and demos for developers, attend events and speak at various events, and many others. DevRel roles involve one or more of these activities. However, why do companies need DevRel?

## Why is DevRel important?
Companies hire DevRel professionals for various reasons, primarily to create a strong connection between their products and the developer community. 

However, what are these reasons, and how do DevRel professionals create this connection?

### Fostering Relationships with the Developers
As a DevRel professional, companies hire you to create and maintain a positive relationship between its products and the users (developers). By offering personalized support and engagement, you can ensure they feel valued and connected to the company's mission.

Building a strong relationship with the developers fosters trust, loyalty, and collaboration, which are essential for long-term success. You can create a healthy relationship with the developers by being open to feedback on the product and ensuring each one is reviewed and acted upon. This shows that the users are valued and their needs are top priority.

### Developer Education and Content Creation
DevRel professionals are responsible for providing educational resources and creating content that empowers developers to understand and use the company's products effectively.

Through tutorials, video content, webinars, blog posts, and other materials, as a DevRel, you are charged with equipping developers with the knowledge needed to overcome challenges and innovate with the company's products. 

### Community Building and Management
DevRel plays a crucial role in building and managing a vibrant developer community around a company's products. They facilitate connections, knowledge-sharing, and collaboration among developers by organizing events, hackathons, and other engaging activities. 

The developers' community provides valuable support, networking opportunities, and peer-to-peer learning experiences. Additionally, it can aid the company's hiring processes by identifying developers who understand the product, are very passionate about it, and would love to contribute to the growth of the company's product to become a part of the team.

### Technical and API Documentation
DevRel ensures that technical documentation and API resources are clear, comprehensive, and easily accessible to developers. Well-documented APIs create a smooth developer experience, enabling developers to use the company's technologies more efficiently. 

Developers should not need to contact the support team to carry out basic tasks. All the product's functionalities should be easily accessible to developers in a clear and comprehensive format. By providing accurate and up-to-date documentation, DevRel enhances the developer experience and encourages widespread adoption of the company's products.

### Developers' Marketing and Influencing
DevRel serves as a liaison between developers and the broader marketing efforts of the company. By sharing developers' success stories, advocating for their needs, and showcasing innovative projects, DevRel influences how the company is perceived within the developer community and beyond. 

A DevRel professional strengthens the company's brand reputation and shapes the product development priorities and strategies to serve the needs of developers.

## How to get jobs in DevRel
There are various ways to position yourself for opportunities and land your next job in DevRel. Here, I will highlight multiple ways to achieve this.

### Contributing to Open Source
Actively contributing to open-source projects related to your areas of interest or expertise can be a great way to make yourself known within the community. It can also be a great plus for you in a job application pool in an organization. 

Open source contributions demonstrate your technical and collaborative skills and commitment to the developer community, all of which are highly valued in DevRel roles.

### Building in Public
Building in a public is an efficient way to attract opportunities. By sharing your projects, insights, and experiences on social media platforms, companies can easily find you and offer opportunities based on your personality, audience, and interests. 

Documenting your journey showcases your passion and expertise and  allows you to connect with like-minded individuals and potential employers who may notice your work.

Consistent content creation demonstrates your ability to communicate complex concepts effectively and manage a developers' community, which is essential in DevRel roles.

Network with professionals in the industry by attending conferences, meetups, and workshops related to developer relations and even developers' products. 

You can also volunteer as a speaker or organizer at such events to increase your visibility and establish yourself as a credible voice within the community.

### Tailor your Resume to each Job
Ensure that your resume is tailored according to the job description or company's requirements. Since the activities of a DevRel in a company can be different from another, ensure that the resume highlights the necessary skills needed for the role. 

Also, include cover letters in your applications. Cover letters help you stand out from other applicants and highlight the relevant experiences, skills, and achievements that align with the specific requirements for the role.

### Job boards and LinkedIn
Set up job alerts on various job boards and be active to ensure you don't miss out on opportunities. Examples of DevRel job boards are  [DevRel Careers](https://devrelcareers.com), [Write the Docs Slack Channel](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack), and many others.
