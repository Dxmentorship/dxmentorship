Desmond is a software engineer building web products with over five years of experience. I have contributed to products at various organizations like Huawei, Advanced Blockchain, Flanksource, and Ansible. 
I'm an open-source contributor and technical writer whose vision is to build great products and make them easy for the world to use. 
I am interested in UX, performance, and code interoperability. I am always working or tinkering on things like blockchain, AI/ML, Cloud Native, and Research. 
You'll see me speaking and engaging communities when I'm not building products.
