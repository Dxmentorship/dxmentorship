In 2020, Khadijah switched from public health to technology, and she has since developed her skills by taking online
courses and attending boot camps. She participates actively in more than 15 Web2 and Web3 communities, including Web3
Ladies, Shecode Africa, Baddies in Tech, Learn Web3 Dao, Hashnode, and others.

She has volunteered as a developer advocate for Coil, an online monetization startup, and as an ambassador for Chimoney.
She is one of the top contributors to the Lazerpay documentation since she enjoys working on open-source projects. She
likes to travel and write articles in her spare time. Frontend development, technical writing, developer relations, and
blockchain development are some of her professional interests.

She has experience with ReactJS, Typescript, Solidity, Polygon, Solana, Ethereum, and Webflow, among other technologies.
