ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Darko. I write software, mostly for the web. I'm also a writer, speaker, community person and Linux nerd. I
enjoy working with the web platform, warts included and I remember the IE6 days (yes, Iâ€™ve been in this industry for 15+
years now ðŸ˜Š).

ðŸ§ª I love the experimental and trailblazing aspect of web development - development should have at least SOME fun in it
ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ‘¥ I run a [meetup](https://beerjs.mk/), help organize a [conference](https://devcon.dev/), have taught at web
academies, and mentored colleagues. Iâ€™ve also spoken at meetups and conferences, taught at web academies, and mentored
colleagues. Iâ€™ve also spoken at meetups and conferences.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve led teams, built apps, and created libraries. Iâ€™ve freelanced and worked as an individual contributor and in
teams. I love FOSS and contribute when I can. My experience spans a large number of industries. You can find my
portfolio [here](https://work.darko.io/).
